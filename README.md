# Build Your Own Movie Ticketing System from Scratch
    This project is to build a movie ticket reservation from scratch. This is a software and logic-based project where you are expected to apply your reasoning and programming skills to understand the requirements of a booking portal. You need to consider the availability of resources such as theaters, movies, seats, pricing and so and consider the ins and outs of a user while dynamically managing the backend. Your input and output objects should have json resemblance and your logic should be functional and in alignment with the test cases.

    ## module 1: Registration setup

        In this module, There is backend script that takes the registration details and stores it in a database. You need to create a table according to the schema and fill in your records. Remember there are validation steps as mentioned in the code.

    ## module 2: Dynamic Ticket Display

        In this module, The objective is to display all available movie shows stored in the database table. You will be provided with the data schema and the necessary data.

 

    ## module 3: selection and booking

        --Retrieve availability data from the database and dynamically check the ticket availability.
        --Upon booking, update the ticket count in the table as specified in the code comments.
